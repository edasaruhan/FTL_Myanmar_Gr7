# 🪖 Helmet Detection System (YOLOv8 + Flask + Docker)

A Computer Vision–based Helmet Detection System built using YOLOv8 and deployed as a Flask API, fully containerized with Docker.
The system detects whether motorcyclists are wearing helmets in images and videos.

## 📌 Features

✅ Helmet detection using YOLOv8

✅ Flask-based REST API

✅ Supports image and video uploads

✅ Dockerized for easy deployment

✅ Stores prediction results automatically

✅ Lightweight and deployment-ready

## 🧠 Model

- Model: YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)

- Weights: best.pt (custom trained)

- Classes: Helmet / No Helmet

- Framework: PyTorch

## 📤 API Usage

🔹 Image Upload

- Upload an image through the web interface

- Detection results are saved in:

```swift
static/results/
```

🔹 Video Upload

- Upload a video file

- Processed videos are saved in:

```swift
static/video_results/
```

## 🧪 Testing
